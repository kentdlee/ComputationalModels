   Welcome!

   Welcome to the support website for Computational Models as taught at Luther College. The text for the course is Peter Linz's Formal Languages and Automata, 5th edition. Do not buy the newer edition as it is formatted differently than the 5th edition. 

   Here you will find some supplementary materials to accompany Linz's text. For the most part what you will find here are descriptions for programming problems. However, in the first chapter there are some introductory topics that are perhaps covered a little too fast for our course. We'll spend some time studying predicate logic and set theory before we launch into the later chapters of Linz's text.
